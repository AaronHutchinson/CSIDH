The script in this folder is used to produce a header file for the CCCDRS
implementation of the two-point method using a custom bound vector and
collection of multiplication-based SIMBA strategies.

To produce the header file simba_withdummy_2.h, do the following:

1. In Octave, set your desired bound vector as the variable b (a column vector),
and your multiplication-based SIMBA substrategies as a cell array Batch, where
Batch{i} is an ordered list of the primes that will be used in the ith SIMBA
substrategy.

For example, if there were 5 primes in total and the bound vector were
b = [2,2,2,1,1], you might have

Batch{1} = [5,1,2]
Batch{2} = [4,3]
Batch{3} = [3,1,2]

In terms of SIMBA strategies and substrategies, this can be interpreted as
saying that the first SIMBA strategy has two multiplication-based SIMBA
substrategies; the first on primes 5, 1, and 2, and the second on primes 4 and
3. In the next round, primes 4 and 5 are done, and we do the full
multiplication-based strategy on primes 3, 1, and 2.

For an example using the 74 CSIDH-512 primes, you can load
DefaultarameterSet.mat, contained in this directory.

2. Save your variables b and Batch to the file FullParameterSet.mat; you can do
this by running

save 'FullParameterSet.mat' 'b' 'Batch'

at the Octave command prompt.

3. At the Octave command prompt, run 

SIMBA_WITHDUMMY_2()

to create the header file simba_withdummy_2.h
