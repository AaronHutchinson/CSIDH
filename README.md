The code contained here is based on two previous implementations:
  -That of Daniel Cervantes-Vazquez, Mathilde Chenu, Jesus-Javier Chi-Domınguez, Luca De Feo, Francisco Rodrıguez-Henrıquez, and Benjamin Smith (CCCDRS) which accompanies the paper "Stronger and Faster Side-Channel Protections for CSIDH". This implementation uses the two-point method (signed key values) and multiplication-based strategies.
  
  -That of Meyer, Campos, and Reith (MCR) which accompanies the paper "On Lions and Elligators: An efficient constant-time implementation of CSIDH". This implementation uses the single-point technique (non-negative key values) and is compatible with any set of valid strategies, permutations, and bound vectors.
