Part of the implementation for the paper "Further Optimizations of CSIDH: A SystematicApproach to Efficient Strategies, Permutations,and Bound Vectors". This code was build on top of that of Meyer, Campos, and Reith given in the paper "On Lions and Elligators: An efficient constant-time implementation of CSIDH"

The code is compatible with any collection of valid strategies, permutations, and bound vectors. Write them into "Sage-GenCode.sage" and compile that file with Sage. This will create (update) the "csidh.c" file which performs the group action. Run Make and execute.
